    <h3>Uber accelerate</h3>

<p>The ride-hailing app’s timetable for an IPO is slow</p>

<p>Uber’s new chief executive says the company might go public between 2019 and 2021. He should go sooner. In Dara Khosrowshahi’s first meeting with employees on Wednesday he told them that — although public life “sucks” because of investors’ short-term focus — the ride-hailing app would eventually do an initial public offering.</p>

<p>In reality, Uber has helped <code>repudiate</code> the idea that venture-backed companies should defer IPOs indefinitely. Employees have been left <strong>demoralised</strong> — or just left — as Uber’s sexual harassment scandal <code>spiralled</code> out of control. An ineffective board failed to <code>impose</code> discipline on executives and then <code>indulged</code> in damaging lawsuits.</p>

<p>Not every public company imposes strong governance but it is hard to imagine that a traditional shareholder base would have allowed the situation to fester.</p>

<p>Public enemies <code>aver</code> that Uber’s share price would have fallen on the scandals. But this has happened anyway. The privilege of privacy has been diluted, thanks to the mutual funds who <code>piled</code> into unicorn investing and are obliged to mark their investments up or down on a quarterly basis. In Uber’s case, Vanguard and Hartford reduced their valuations by 15 per cent at the end of June.</p>

<p>Of course, the main reason to wait would be that Uber cannot demonstrate that it has a sustainable business on a path to profitability. If that were the case it should worry Mr Khosrowshahi, who has just <code>swapped</code> $150m of Expedia options for an undisclosed slice of Uber.</p>

<p>Critics <code>contend</code> that Uber’s business model is fundamentally flawed. The surprising fightback from Lyft, a local competitor who has taken recent share from Uber, shows that global monopoly is not straightforward.</p>

<p>From what is visible from the company’s <code>skimpy</code> financial releases, however, Uber is on course to make about $8bn a year in “adjusted” revenues, net of the portion paid to the drivers, and heavy, though diminishing, losses.</p>

<p>If Uber is viewed as a typical internet company, those revenues are more than adequate to support its current $70bn valuation. Snap, the <strong>lossmaking</strong> messaging app that has arguably fiercer competition than Uber, went public this year at a $20bn valuation on just $400m of annual revenues.</p>

<p>Employees and current investors would gain liquidity. Public shareholders can, in fact, be perfectly patient — just ask Elon Musk. Privacy is not a shield but a burden for Uber.</p>
